Hi KMO, I’m a long time listener, NOT a subscriber (I promised I’d become one of yours and congressional dish as soon as I’m not in between jobs), and I just listened to malignant useless episode.

Yes, I know, you don’t agree with the premises, I’m just emailing to add to the argument…

I find this nihilism very american...

It equates nature with life, life with humanity, humanity with Western history, Western history with scientific/industrial revolution, and revolution with capitalism. And of course, capitalism as America. Us.

All the while wrapping it all up with the Universe itself, as if its macro, micro, temporal dimensions have anything to do with your inadequacies inside imagetic capitalism.

In a sense, this is the angst-ridden, male version of Amy Schumer Universe sketch.

Also… maybe it’s me going all SJ on you… but

Assuming most people that subscribe to this american nihilism are white, male, plus the bright point you made that it’s a belief system that doesn’t ask anything back of you (keep your power, privilege and comfort), while granting the believer this aura of depth and mysteriousness and cowboy aloofness...

All in a setting where women and minorities fight for less systemic oppression… 

It’s all rather convenient, and I ask if it’s not discontent projected into something else, to hide its origins.
